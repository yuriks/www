			<h2>About</h2>
			<div class="content_box">
				<p>My name is Yuri Kunde Schlesner and I'm a 20-year old (as of 2011-09) student of Computer Science and computers and programming enthusiast. Primary areas of interest are computer graphics, game engines, game development and related areas, though I dabble into pretty much anything. I've been interested in game development ever since I've started playing games on my dad's brand new Pentium I. One day I found QBASIC.EXE hidden in the system folders, and the rest is history.</p>
				<p>Here you'll find some info about my projects, as well as info I think may be useful to me or someone else. Perhaps in the future I'll also start writing a blog here. (Writing is good for you!)</p>
